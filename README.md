##Set up a new Polymer Dart app

1. Create a new folder for your app in your Dart projects folder using Windows Explorer or Mac Finder.
2. Copy the contents of the Polymer_Template folder into your new app folder.
3. Using the Dart Editor, select File->Open Existing Folder... (or use Ctrl+O).
4. Select your new app folder to import it into the Editor.
5. The Dart Editor should do this automatically, but if not, in the Dart Editor's Files panel, right-click the new project's pubspec.yaml file and select Pub Get to install all needed dependencies.
6. If your project shows errors at this point, select the root of your project in the Dart Editor's Files panel and select Tools->Reanalyze Sources (or use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+B).
